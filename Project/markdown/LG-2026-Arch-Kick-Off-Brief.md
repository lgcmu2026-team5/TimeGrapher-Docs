###### Produces 3 sounds per beat:

- ● First noise occurs when the impulse-pin of the roll strikes the fork of the pallets.
- ● Second noise occurs when a tooth on the escape wheel begins sliding across the impulse face of a pallet stone
- ● The third noise is created when a tooth of the escape-wheel meets the lockingplane of the pallet-stone and the lever hits the banking-pin.

### Measuring Acoustic Signal

We can observe, interpret, and diagnose a mechanical watch from its acoustic signal With machines, we can graph the watch behavior

- ● Functions as a diagnostic aid, not just a graphing tool
- ● Helps determine:


- ○ whether the watch is running accurately
- ○ whether the beat pattern is stable
- ○ whether amplitude is healthy
- ○ whether there are signs of mechanical problems


We can enhance the graphs with labels, markers, alerts, interactive features, derived measures, and explanatory text to make results easy to understand in real time

We can improve usability through filtering and signal clarity

● Reduce extraneous noise while preserving features needed for correct detection and analysis

Let’s see a demonstration!

##### Overview of Play Modes

###### Live

![image 6](<LG-2026-Arch-Kick-Off-Brief_images/imageFile6.png>)

- Captures and analyzes signal data directly from the microphone in real time.

###### Playback

- Uses a previously recorded signal instead of live microphone input.

###### Sim

- Generates a synthetic watch signal for testing and

development.

#### Desired TimeGrapher System Quality Attributes

Extensibility

- • Real Time Performance: The system shall acquire, process, analyze, and display watch acoustic data in real time.

- • Low Latency and Low Number of Missed Beats: The system shall minimize end-to-end latency between acoustic capture at the microphone and presentation of the corresponding waveform, markers, and computed values in the GUI.

- • Correctness: The system shall compute watch-performance measures accurately and consistently, with displayed values and graphs that remain aligned with the underlying events across the GUI and summaries.

- • Measurement Accuracy, Error Detection, and Handling: The system shall detect the relevant watch events with sufficient accuracy to support meaningful measurement of small timing differences.

- • Extensibility, Modifiability: The system shall be easy to understand, extend, test, and debug within the limited project schedule.

# Goals of the Project

- • Understand the influence of architectural drivers on software structures.
- • Understand the technical, organizational, and business role of software architecture.
- • Recognize the importance of quality attributes, document quality attribute requirements, and choose among tactics and patterns that help to realize requirements of performance, accuracy, security, extensibility, etc.
- • Identify fundamental architecture structures (modules, components and connectors, deployment, etc.) and key architectural approaches (styles, patterns, tactics, etc.).
- • Understand the principles of good architecture documentation and presentation.
- • Learn how to document an architecture using multiple views, using informal notations and UML, complementing structural diagrams with behavior diagrams, and recording design decisions.

❏ Experimentation results, design, plan for construction

❏ Demo and lessons learned

##### Final Comments and Hints

###### A few cautions:

Read the Project Plan in its entirety Know the code and how it actually works Look for better ways to design or implement functionality and quality attributes then the source code provided

- - Not every issue in this project will be caused by software.
- - Variations in watch condition, sensor placement, microphone coupling, and ambient noise can all influence the measured results.
- - A solution that performs well on a PC may still require optimization to achieve the project’s real-time, latency, and performance goals on the Raspberry Pi.
- - Teams should therefore test and evaluate their design on the target hardware, not only on their development machines.
