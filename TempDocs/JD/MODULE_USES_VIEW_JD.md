# TimeGrapher Module Uses View - JD Draft

## 1. Primary Presentation

This view translates the homework-style source dependency diagram into the C#/.NET structure of TimeGrapher. The view should not enumerate every source file. It should show the architectural dependency direction first, then refine the major projects into folders/modules.

Notation:

- `A --> B`: A uses B.
- `-. RID conditional .->`: dependency included only for matching runtime identifiers.
- `Core --> none`: Core has no UI, platform, or external package dependency.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    App["TimeGrapher.App<br/>Avalonia UI / rendering / run control"]
    Core["TimeGrapher.Core<br/>analysis engine / contracts"]
    Win["TimeGrapher.Platform.WindowsAudio<br/>Windows live audio adapter"]
    Linux["TimeGrapher.Platform.LinuxAudio<br/>Linux live audio adapter"]
    Verify["TimeGrapher.Verify<br/>headless verification client"]

    App --> Core
    App -. "RID conditional: win-*" .-> Win
    App -. "RID conditional: linux-*" .-> Linux
    Win --> Core
    Linux --> Core
    Verify --> Core
```

Core dependency rule:

```text
TimeGrapher.Core -> no project reference, no package reference
```

Evidence files:

- `src/TimeGrapher.App/TimeGrapher.App.csproj`
- `src/TimeGrapher.Core/TimeGrapher.Core.csproj`
- `src/TimeGrapher.Platform.WindowsAudio/TimeGrapher.Platform.WindowsAudio.csproj`
- `src/TimeGrapher.Platform.LinuxAudio/TimeGrapher.Platform.LinuxAudio.csproj`
- `src/TimeGrapher.Verify/TimeGrapher.Verify.csproj`

## 2. Element Catalog

| Element | Responsibility | Uses |
|---|---|---|
| `TimeGrapher.App` | Avalonia UI, graph rendering, tabs, run lifecycle, user settings | `Core`, platform audio adapters by RID, Avalonia, ScottPlot |
| `TimeGrapher.Core` | detection, metrics, audio contracts, simulation, frame/projector logic | none at project/package level |
| `TimeGrapher.Platform.WindowsAudio` | Windows audio capture implementation | `Core.Shared`, NAudio |
| `TimeGrapher.Platform.LinuxAudio` | Linux/Pi audio capture implementation | `Core.Shared`, Linux audio CLI stack |
| `TimeGrapher.Verify` | headless detector-quality verification | `Core` |

## 4. Context / Scope

Included:

- Runtime source projects under `src/`.
- Runtime-relevant folder/module dependencies.
- `.csproj` project/package reference evidence.

Excluded:

- `bin/`
- `obj/`
- generated files
- publish output
- full inventory of every individual `.cs` file
- test project details unless a separate testability view is needed

## 5. Variability Guide

Platform audio is bound by RID:

| RID condition | Included adapter |
|---|---|
| development/no RID | WindowsAudio + LinuxAudio |
| `win-*` | WindowsAudio |
| `linux-*` | LinuxAudio |

This keeps OS-specific audio code outside `Core` while allowing one App project to publish for Windows and Raspberry Pi/Linux targets.

## 6. Design Rationale / ADR Links

- `Core` remains dependency-free to preserve testability, portability, and modifiability.
- Platform audio is isolated in adapter projects so OS APIs do not leak into `Core`.
- The analysis flow is documented as partial Pipe-and-Filter; see `ADR-002-partial-pipe-and-filter.md`.
